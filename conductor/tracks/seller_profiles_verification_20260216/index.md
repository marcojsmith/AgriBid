# Track: Seller Profiles & Verification

## Objective
Build marketplace trust by implementing public seller profiles, reputation metrics, and an admin-verified status.

## Status
- **Start Date:** 2026-02-16
- **Status:** Completed
- **Priority:** High

## Context
High-value agricultural transactions rely on the reputation of the seller. Currently, the platform only shows a name. We need to expose seller history and verification status to bridge the "Trust Gap" identified in the Brief.
