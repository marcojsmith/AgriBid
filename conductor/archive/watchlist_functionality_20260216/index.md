# Watchlist Functionality

This track implements the core functionality for users to "watch" and track auctions of interest.

## Key Goals
- Add `watchlist` table to Convex schema.
- Implement `toggleWatchlist` mutation and `isWatched` query.
- Create `MyWatchlist` page to list watched auctions.
- Integrate "Heart" icon/button into `AuctionCard` and `AuctionDetail`.
- Ensure authenticated access only.
