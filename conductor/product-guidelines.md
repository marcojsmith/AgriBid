# Product Guidelines: AgriBid

## 1. Communication Tone
- **Professional & Direct**: All copy and communication must be clear, precise, and efficient. We prioritize expertise and reliability, avoiding unnecessary jargon while being direct about transaction details and auction states.
- **Trust-Centric**: Communication should reinforce security and transparency, ensuring users feel confident in the integrity of the marketplace.

## 2. Visual Design Principles
- **Clarity & Utility**: The UI must prioritize information hierarchy and density, particularly in the auction dashboard. High-value data (current bids, timers, equipment specs) should be immediately accessible and easy to parse.
- **Premium Marketplace Aesthetic**: We employ a polished and high-end look using professional photography and modern, stylized icons to differentiate AgriBid as a premier destination for heavy machinery.

## 3. Imagery and Iconography
- **Polished Photography**: Equipment images should be professionally presented, emphasizing the quality and scale of the machinery.
- **Stylized Iconography**: Use modern, clean icons that provide a sophisticated feel while remaining recognizable to industry professionals.

## 4. Notifications and Alerts
- **High Urgency for Critical Events**: Outbids, auction wins, and "ending soon" alerts must be prominent and immediate (e.g., real-time toasts) to ensure users never miss a critical bidding window.
- **Action-Oriented**: Alerts should provide clear next steps, allowing users to react quickly to changes in auction status.

## 5. Technical Language
- **Expert & Precise**: We assume a high level of expertise from our users. Use industry-standard terms (e.g., PTO, hour meter, hydraulic flow) accurately and without over-explanation to build credibility with professional farmers and dealers.
